# Contact Management App

This is a simple contact management app built with React and Redux. It allows users to fetch, add, update, and delete contacts from a mock API.

## Features

- **Fetch and Show Users**: Fetches users from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays them in a list.

- **Add a Contact**: Allows users to add a new contact. Upon submission, a POST request is made to the JSONPlaceholder API, although it's a dummy request as data cannot be added to the server.

- **Update a Contact**: Users can update an existing contact. This triggers a PUT request to the JSONPlaceholder API, again a dummy call.

- **Delete a Contact**: Provides functionality to delete a contact. This initiates a DELETE request to the JSONPlaceholder API, also a dummy call.
